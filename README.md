## _Challenge to demonstrate my skills and how I work._ 

### Developed with:
<img src="https://ctnovatec.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/nodejs-logo.png" alt="Node.js" width=150px>

Algorithm developed to solve the three tasks presented by the challenge.

## About the Challenge

### Challenge splitted in 3 Steps:
  - 1ยบ Step: Make a GET request in REST API (Contracts) and generate a CSV file with found data.
  - 2ยบ Step: Create a new user using a POST request in REST API (User_importer) and check that it was created successfully.
  - 3ยบ Step: Make a request in API Graphql, getting the same data as in the First Step.
 
 _**At the end of each step a CSV file is generated to check the changes.**_
 
 ## Tech
 
 Libraries used in development:
 
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - Backend
- [Moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment) - Library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.
- [Dot-Env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) - Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a _.env file_ into _process.env_
- [Json2Csv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json2csv) - Converts json into csv with column titles and proper line endings.
- [Got](https://sequelize.org/) - Human-friendly and powerful HTTP request library for Node.js

 ## Installation
 
 Algorithm needs [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.
 
 After cloning the repository, install all necessary dependencies...
 
 ```sh
cd challenge-qulture-rocks
npm i
```
Start the code

```sh
node index.js
```

The Log of the algorithm is well described, showing its progress step by step.

Any questions, I am available!
